# Pnemonia-detection-in-Chest-X-Ray-images
The main aim of this project is to compare the performance of the ensemble model based on three models with themself individually. Ensemble methods are the techniques that create multiple machine learning models and then combine them to produce improved results. In this project, I had Developed Three models using transfer learning and constructed a voting-based optimal ensemble towards the pneumonia detection problem. In the end, the optimal ensemble model has greater accuracy in classification than the individual models
