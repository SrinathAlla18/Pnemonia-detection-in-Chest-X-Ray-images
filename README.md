# Pnemonia-detection-in-Chest-X-Ray-images
â€¢	Ensemble methods are the techniques that create multiple  machine learning models and then combine them to produce improved results.Developed Three models using transfer learning and constructed a voting based optimal ensemble towards the pneumonia detection problem. The resultworks better than all the individual models
