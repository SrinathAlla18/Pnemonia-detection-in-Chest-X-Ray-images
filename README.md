# Pnemonia-detection-in-Chest-X-Ray-images using Neural Ensemble
The main aim of the project is to create an ensemble model to show that there is certain amount of improvement in accuracy in classification compared to the initial models. Ensemble methods are the techniques that create multiple machine learning models and then combine them to produce improved results. In this project, I had Developed Three models using transfer learning and constructed a voting-based optimal ensemble towards the pneumonia detection problem. In the end, the optimal ensemble model has greater accuracy in classification than the individual models
