# Pnemonia-detection-in-Chest-X-Ray-images
the main aim of this project is to compare the performace of ensemble model based on three  models with themself individally. Ensemble methods are the techniques that create multiple  machine learning models and then combine them to produce improved results.In this project, I had Developed Three models using transfer learning and constructed a voting based optimal ensemble towards the pneumonia detection problem. In the end the final ensemble model has greater accuracy in classifaction than the individual models
